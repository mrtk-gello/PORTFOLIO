      <h3>Why I Made This Portfolio</h3>
      <div class="card p-4">
        <p>This portfolio was first and foremost created as a major requirement for the Human Computer Interaction subject.<br>
          But more than that, it became a digital archive of my hard work, growth, and creativity.<br>
          It allows easy access to my work for future academic or professional use.<br><br>
          The goal is to create something that not only satisfies school requirements but also serves as a personal collection of my progress—both academically and personally. This portfolio stands as a reflection of how far I've come, and how far I'm willing to go as a lifelong learner.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The Web Design project for our eCommerce assignment was one of the most intense parts of the semester. With a tight deadline and barely any progress, I decided to pull an all-nighter at a classmate’s house—though I only managed an hour of sleep. The task was individual, but I still found myself fueled by coffee, snacks, and determination. I spent the night debugging, designing, and pushing through exhaustion. Although the website didn't fully function yet, I was able to meet the deadline. Despite the chaos, it was a great learning experience, and I was proud of how much I accomplished on my own.</p>

            <p class="card-text">For our final project, which was creating a personal website portfolio, the journey was just as challenging. The video shows snippets of the code behind the website, still a work in progress as I continue editing and refining it. The sleepless nights and constant revisions have been overwhelming, but they’ve been necessary to get closer to the vision I have for this portfolio. Every line of code, every tweak in design has been a step toward something I can be proud of. Although it’s not finished yet, I’m hopeful that with continued effort, it will bloom into a meaningful representation of my skills and growth.</p>

As a beginner in web design, I had little experience with coding but had a background in other design work, which helped me create the layout and structure. Despite being new to web design, I managed to complete the mockup ahead of the deadline and presented it with confidence. The hard work paid off when I received a perfect score for the project. It was a moment of personal achievement, marking the beginning of my journey into the world of web design.<br></p>

        <p>Dear Future Me,<br><br>
          First of all, thank you for your patience and perseverance throughout this journey. Creating this portfolio wasn’t easy—there were many moments of doubt, revisions, and learning from scratch. But look at you now, not only did you finish it, you made it meaningful.<br><br>
          Never forget how this portfolio started from zero knowledge of web development and turned into something you can truly be proud of. Use this as a reminder that with consistent effort, learning and growth are always possible.<br><br>
          Keep creating, keep learning, and never stop dreaming.<br><br>
          Sincerely,<br>
          Your Past Self ❤️

    // Typewriter Text
    const text = "At first, I had no background in website development or coding. I felt overwhelmed by the complexity of the concepts and the vast amount of information to grasp. But through persistence and learning, I’ve been able to pick up the skills needed to bring this project to life. The journey wasn’t always smooth, and there were many times when I felt discouraged, questioning whether I had made the right choice. Despite these challenges, I chose to embrace each obstacle as an opportunity to grow. I spent countless hours researching, experimenting, and troubleshooting issues, which ultimately deepened my understanding of the development process. There were moments when I struggled to find a solution, but I kept pushing forward, always looking for answers, whether through online resources, asking for help, or revisiting the fundamentals. Every line of code I wrote, every design element I adjusted, and every feature I implemented felt like a small victory. This portfolio is not just a collection of my work; it’s a reflection of my journey, the hard work, and the growth I’ve experienced as a developer. It serves as a reminder that with determination and a willingness to learn, I can overcome challenges and continue to improve.
