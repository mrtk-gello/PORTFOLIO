The JavaScript logic uses loops and event listeners to calculate and display the results in a clean, organized layout. It’s a helpful tool for students and anyone practicing basic math skills.',
        reflection: 'Creating this project helped me get more comfortable with loops in JavaScript, especially the use of for loops to generate repetitive content dynamically. I also practiced validating input to ensure users enter a valid number. It was satisfying to see how a simple concept like multiplication could be turned into an interactive learning tool. This project reminded me that even basic programming logic can make learning more engaging and accessible when combined with a user-friendly interface.',

Each activity showcases my progress in understanding fundamental programming concepts like conditionals, loops, functions, and DOM manipulation. The portfolio is designed to be user-friendly, organized, and visually consistent with my overall web development theme.',
        reflection: 'This finals portfolio reflects not just the culmination of my work, but the journey I took to learn, practice, and grow in my coding abilities. Looking back at each project, I can see how my problem-solving skills improved and how I became more confident in applying JavaScript in practical scenarios. Compiling everything into one cohesive platform also taught me the importance of documentation, presentation, and user experience. More than just a requirement, this portfolio became a meaningful reminder of how far I’ve come in just one semester.',
